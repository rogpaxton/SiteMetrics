##SiteMetrics

#Purpose

Problem: Many industries collect massive amounts of data from remote job site locations, yet few tools exist to visualize and assess site performance. Example industries include
    -Mining: Tracking performance of individual mines
    -Manufacturing: Tracking performance of separate production facilities
    -Science: Tracking performance of multiple laboratories

Solution: SiteMetrics is a robust platform for conditioning data and providing data visualization. A dashboard presents site locations, and the performance metrics of the site, individual metric goals, and overall performance score for the site appear as a popup.

Purpose: SiteMetrics provides a powerful visualization tool for immediate and intuitive evaluation of job site performance.

Future Directions: Moving forward, an algorithm will be integrated for prediction of site performance in discrete metrics, as well as overall performance.
